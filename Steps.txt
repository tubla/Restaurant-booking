RestaurantBooking APP Steps:

- Create Preject Structure

- CREATE AZURE SQL SERVER AND DATABASE
  ------------------------------------
  
- Add your local ip to the firewall
	 - your DB -> set server firewall - add local ip in the firewall rules section
     - After that, turn on "Allow Azure Services and resources" in able to access this server to "Yes".

- Then save all your changes.
- Connect locally to azure sql server using sql management tool

- Configure nuget packages for EF migration in Data project
	- Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core
	- Microsoft.EntityFramework.Core.Design 
	- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions
	
- Configure nuget packages for EF migration in Core project
	- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

- Now Configure connectionstring in appsettings.json
- Create DBContext class in Data project
- Add Data,Core and Service project references to API project and configure dbcontext in program.cs

- Create models in Core project 
- Run add-migration in Data project as DbContext class exists in this project
- Implement Restaurant Repository class in Data
- Implement Restaurant Service class in Service Project
- Add Restaurant Controller in API project and implement API endpoints

- CREATE AZURE WEB APP -> App Service
  -----------------------------------

- Publish your API project to the azure app service
- try accessing the API swagger endpoint after publish is completed
	=> https://rr-restaurant-booking-app-api.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html
	- It will not work as we need to set connection string in azure app service

- Go to your Web App -> Configuaration -> In Connection Strings section add a new connection string
									-> Provide the Same connection name as there in your appsettings.json as code will be looking for this variable name
									-> Provide connection string
									-> Change to SQL Server
									-> Save and now you'll be able to test it.

- Go to your web app -> monitoring -> log stream -> logs are disabled (This is very important for debugging the issue, otherwise will not get to know what is happening in the background)

- LETS ENABLE LOGS IN WEB APP (APPLICATION INSIGHTS and SERILOG)
  ---------------------------
- Go to your web app -> Settings -> Application Insights -> Enable it
					 -> Go to .Net Core -> and enable all(Recommended, Interop, Profiler, Snapshot..)
					 -> Apply
					 -> Go to top -> Click View Application Insights Data -> Copy connection string
					 
- Back to VS -> Install below nuget packages in API project 

					- Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore
					- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices
					- Serilog.Sinks.ApplicationInsights
					- Serilog.AspNetCore
